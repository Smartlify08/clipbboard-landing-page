## My process

I started off by creating a sort of wireframe, and checking responsiveness across all screens before adding proper styling, to make my work easier and faster.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would love to add the about and home pages to this website and add some functionality to it.
